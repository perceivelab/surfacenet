## Abstract

In this paper we present **SurfaceNet**, an approach for estimating spatially-varying bidirectional reflectance distribution function (SVBRDF) material properties from a single image.
We pose the problem as an image translation task and propose a novel patch-based generative adversarial network (GAN) that is able to produce high-quality, high-resolution surface reflectance maps. The employment of the GAN paradigm has a twofold objective: 1) allowing the model to recover finer details than standard translation models; 2) reducing the domain shift between synthetic and real data distributions in an unsupervised way.

An extensive evaluation, carried out on a public benchmark of synthetic and real images under different illumination conditions, shows that **SurfaceNet** largely outperforms existing SVBRDF reconstruction methods, both quantitatively and qualitatively.
Furthermore, **SurfaceNet** exhibits a remarkable ability in generating high-quality maps from real samples without any supervision at training time.
